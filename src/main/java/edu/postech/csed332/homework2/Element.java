/**
 * The Element class is the superclass of both Book and Collection. 
 * It contains a reference to the parent collection 
 * that directly contains this element. 
 * 
 * An element can directly belong to at most one parent collection, 
 * but that collection can belong to other collections, 
 * so an element can indirectly belong to several collections.
 * 
 * It is optional for your Library code to enforce that no collection 
 * can (even indirectly) belong to itself, i.e., the graph of connections
 *  along parentCollection should be acyclic.
 *  
 * You should not modify the Element class. 
 * Its two methods have been already implemented.
